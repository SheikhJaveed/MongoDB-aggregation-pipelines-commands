# MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines Examples

This repository contains examples of MongoDB aggregation pipelines, demonstrating various data transformation and analysis techniques using the MongoDB Aggregation Framework.

## ðŸ“Œ What is MongoDB Aggregation?
MongoDB aggregation is a powerful framework for processing and analyzing data in a collection. It allows you to filter, group, transform, and compute aggregated results using a series of pipeline stages.


## ðŸš€ Aggregation Pipeline Stages
Here are some commonly used stages in MongoDB aggregation:

- `$match` â†’ Filters documents based on conditions.
- `$group` â†’ Groups documents by a specified key.
- `$sort` â†’ Sorts documents by a field.
- `$project` â†’ Reshapes documents by specifying which fields to include/exclude.
- `$limit` â†’ Limits the number of documents in output.
- `$lookup` â†’ Performs a left outer join to another collection.
- `$unwind` â†’ Deconstructs an array field into separate documents.

## ðŸ›  How to Run Aggregations
1. Open MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`) or MongoDB Compass.
2. Select your database and collection.
3. Run an aggregation query using:
   ```js
   db.collection.aggregate(pipeline)
   ```
